I also call this the Hyperjank

I had a Hypercube. And then I didn't want a Hypercube anymore so I made the XY gantry compatible with Voron design’s Afterburner and potentially Stealthburner system.

Frame and linear rails measurements are in BOM section

BOM (incomplete)
m5 45mm x18
m5 50mm x2
m5 10mm x16
m5 16mm x36
m3 50mm x2
m3 16mm x8
m3 30mm x8

m3 heatset insert x14

a whole lot of m3 & m5 T-nuts

everything should take about 800g of filament

Frame (for 300x300 print area):
3030 485mm x 7
3030 520mm x 8
3030 700mm x 4
2020 260mm x 2
2020 515mm x 2
2020 460mm x 1

MGN12H 370mm x 3 (this is just what I have laying around)
If your rails don’t fit use non-FB (for Full Build because I’m a dum dum and don’t know how to name stuff) versions of the top idler and motor mount

Smooth gt2 6mm wide idler pulley x10
20 teeth gt2 6mm wide idler pulley x2

Idlers bore are 5mm

I have not tested this and have no idea how well it works so if you decide to try it, do it at your own risk.

UPDATE: 23/05/2022

Z chain

UPDATE: 11/05/2022

fixed idlers nut holes
adjusted gantry for chain clearance

UPDATE: 06/04/2022

updated tolerances

UPDATE: 30/03/2022

Flipped the gantry upside down so that I could reuse the bed from the Hevo with the added 12mm rod mount, changed endstop setup

UPDATE: 27/02/2022

added microswitch endstops for X and Y
